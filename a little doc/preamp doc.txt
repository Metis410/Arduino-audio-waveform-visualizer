This preamp project main objective is tobe a way to learn how to use an opamp as a differential amp and learning more about dynamic microphone

Scope:
-portable
-easy to build
-components off the shelve
-decent preamp
-mainly for mic with a transformer
-audio output at line level and for headphone

Function (Interface):
-adjustable: headphone and line output, opamp gain, wave display
-port for charging and for code modification (not in the same port)

-Inside(software):
+ 1st screen:
++ display waveform of audio input
++ adjustable wave

+ 2nd screen:
++ display measure voltage/ chip temp, best voltage indicator, and batter percent (if you use a different board with more pin you can add a current reader if you like)

-Components:
BMS 4s or 5s(if possible)
4s or 5s charger
buck converter
an adc (Optional. If you like your wave to be the best)
7 segments voltage display
2 switches
4 pots
an esp32 c3 or any esp32 for best performent
tft screen
a touch sensor
4 3.5 3 knots female jack or 4 knots 
audio amp for headphone( recommend getting a 5v one)
2 opamp ne5532
(not listed in here are mainly single electrical component like resistor and capacitor)

BUILDING
-the main amplifier;
+ require: 2 opamp ne5532, resistor, capacitor(catalytic and ceramic), battery 4s or 5s (as long as its more than 5v, boost converter not recomented due to noise),
