-visualizer only, contain only the bare minimum to visualise a waveform user will have to do some manual work

-full, contain only the the funtion with an fps display, use the skematic for connection 

-OG, contain the full code that iam currently using in my preamp

Skematic for MCU are design to be use with a preamp but it will work fine with smaller input, i recommend using a device audio output as a source
